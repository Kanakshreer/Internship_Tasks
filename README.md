This project is part of my internship at **Future Intern** under the task "Social Media Sentiment Analysis".

## 📌 Objective

To develop a machine learning model that predicts house prices based on features like:
- Median Income
- House Age
- Number of Rooms
- Latitude & Longitude
- ...and more

## 📂 Files Included

- `house_price_prediction.py` – main script
- `house_price_model.pkl` – trained Decision Tree model
- `scaler.pkl` – feature scaler used before prediction
- `README.md` – this file!

## 📈 Technologies Used

- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- joblib

## 🧠 Models Used

- **Linear Regression**
- **Decision Tree Regressor** (tuned with GridSearchCV)

✅ Final model used: **Tuned Decision Tree** with MSE of **0.417**
